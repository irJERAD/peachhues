cook at home for culture, health, and fun.  

>There is nothing better than a home cooked meal  
- some hungry person  

There is a reason that has become such a wellknown phrase. A home cooked meal is more than fresh food to a hungry belly. Cooking from home is a cultural activity that connects us with time in our own history and beyond.  
The smell of your favorite breakfast meal can take you back to your childhood, sitting down with you folks and siblings on a late weekend morning. Some of our best times as a family are created at the dinner table. Its where we get to take a break from our busy schedules and see each other face-to-face for more than just nutritional sustenance. We get to here about one another day, layout plans for our weekend, call dibs on what Television show we will watch afterwards or what piece you will be in a family board game.  

When you cook at home you know what is in your meal. You can be sure its actual food and not some additive phthalates (however that's pronounced) to keep bugs away or Petroleum (yes petroleum) to make what you are eating look like what its supposed to be.  

You can save a buck or two. The average commercially-prepared meal costs $13. On the other hand, the average meal prepared from home costs approximately $4 for grocies. Thats a $9 savings per person per meal! Multiply that by 4 people per family at 3 meals a day and that totals as much as **$48 - PER DAY** [Source](https://www.moneyunder30.com/the-true-cost-of-eating-in-restaurants-and-how-to-save#:~:text=The%20average%20commercially%2Dprepared%20meal,savings%20per%20person%20per%20meal). The calculated savings are astounding and even now leave me awestruck. Specially when I think about the reliability of those long lines at [In-N-Out Burger](https://www.in-n-out.com/).
