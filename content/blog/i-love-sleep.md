>“Sleep is the best meditation.”  
— Dalai Lama  

There are few things in life I enjoy more than sleep. This makes getting out and about on a long list of TODO's a difficult chore. It seems my lush bed and favorite pillow are always calling me off to indulge in another cozy siesta.

Fortunately for me, I find it hard to fall asleep with anything left on my task list. If it wasn't for this internal nag that keeps me from relaxing enough to enjoy a leisurely nap I don't think I would ever get much of anything done and my life would be forfeit to a gluttony of slothful sin.
