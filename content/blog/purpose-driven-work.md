Meaningful and purpose-driven work is the secret to everlasting happiness. That's it. simple right?  
Now I never said this was going to be easy, just simple. Many people devote their entire lives just to find this work! How could they possible get to spend their lives doing it? The sad thing is, most people don't get to invest their life's labor into that something.  

But I've got something else for you. I know how you can get there faster! and here it is:  
**Keep Trying New Things**  

Now I don't think you should keep quitting your job each time you find a task remedial and start your search all over from the ground up. No. You should, *however*,  

**1. Always be on the job market**  
Unless you are one of the lucky ones already situated at the throne of your life's passion and true purpose, then you should always think like someone who is willing to take on a new professional challenge. You don't need to spend hours each week searching for a new job or even looking at new companies. It is much easier to  

**2. Consider a lateral move with your current employer**  
It can sometimes be easier to find mobility within your current employers domain than to reach outside. You may find yourself much fulfilled sitting down the office corridor on a different team that employs your skills in a way you feel meaningful.  
Searching for jobs is not always the way to find them. Peer-to-peer references and introductions are a much more powerful way in the door. In-fact, again rather than spending hours searching for a new job,  

**3. go to events aligned with your passions and socialize**  
I much prefer a night of good company, interesting conversation and sometimes free pizza and drinks at a networking event than losing the hours alone behind the face of my computer searching [linkedin]("https//linkedin.com") for any alternative opportunities.  

I hope these suggestions provide you with a strategy to constantly be on the search for that place in your life and profession where you are not ~~*working to live*~~ but truly **living through your work**
