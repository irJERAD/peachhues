>My home, **Tahiti**, is famous for its luxury getaways and remote beaches pouring with pristine white or ebony black sand.

My home away from home, **San Diego California**, isn't half bad either. Known for wonderful weather and world class surfing and surfers. I guess *you can get the sand off me but you can't get me off the sand* ;-).
