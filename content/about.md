### Hello, my name is **Stephanie Acosta**

Creative and empathetic UI/UX designer here ..  

A passion to craft beautify that satisfies users needs in a product;  
A best idea generator.  

Each and every morning, as the sun creeps over the mountain pass to illuminate my garden, is where you can find me; furnishing the wants of my every plant and creature with love and superfluous attention.


>Can you hear that?  
A call of nature,  
A call to me.  
Now I'm going back  
Where I ought to be.  


>I hear it all day every day.  
Little chirps in the sky,  
a ray of light across the ground;  
The smell of flowers blossoming from the shrubbery.  
```
The many beauties of nature call me to a labor of love in the garden.  There I can pour myself out and receive only grace and elegance in return. The garden is a beautiful place as I have been raised to appreciate.  

It is no wonder nature, in the many forms that it calls to me, is the dominant character of my influence.  Nature, in the most sensual of expressions has become what I live for.  

To share this frame of mind, this gift to dive into the terrestrial qualia to be embraced with aesthetic love and nurturing purpose; to point out the exotic attractiveness that is flora is my passion.  
To express this through a medium of art is my work.
